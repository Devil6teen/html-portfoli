<p>Hi my name is Anas. I am a web developer. This is my first Portfolio website which i am developing. 
  If i talk about my previous education i am not from the background of computer studies. 
  But i am really interested i this field. So i started to learn more about this. </p>

<p> It has been more than 2 weeks i am learning this and right now i am using all the elements and tags which i have learned till now.
  I am learning and enjoying this process throughout but sometimes the things become difficult but by doing some work and analyzing on it i can dind the solution for it. </p>

<p> My further plan is to develop my skills at extreme level and join some reputable company to utilize my skills which i am learning. </p>
